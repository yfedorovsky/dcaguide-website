## Why DCA Guide Exists

Buying Bitcoin can feel overwhelming. The price swings, the technical jargon, the fear of buying at the wrong time — it stops a lot of people from ever getting started.

**DCA Guide was built to fix that.**

Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is the simplest, most time-tested strategy for building a Bitcoin position. Instead of trying to time the market, you invest a fixed amount on a regular schedule — weekly, biweekly, or monthly. It removes emotion from the equation and lets compounding do the work.

## What You'll Find Here

- **Beginner-friendly guides** that explain Bitcoin DCA in plain English
- **Strategy breakdowns** comparing different DCA frequencies and amounts
- **Historical data analysis** showing how DCA has performed over various time periods
- **Platform reviews** to help you pick the right place to set up recurring buys
- **Common mistakes** and how to avoid them

## Our Approach

We believe in:

- **Simplicity over complexity.** You don't need to be a trader. You don't need charts. You need a plan and consistency.
- **Education over hype.** We're not here to tell you Bitcoin is going to the moon. We're here to show you a disciplined approach to accumulation.
- **Transparency.** Some links on this site are affiliate links. We only recommend products we'd use ourselves, and we always disclose when we earn a commission.

## Disclosure

DCA Guide participates in affiliate programs, including the River affiliate program. When you sign up through our links, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you. This helps us keep the site running and continue producing free educational content.

**Nothing on this site is financial advice.** We're educators, not financial advisors. Always do your own research and consider your personal financial situation before making any investment decisions.
