If you're new to Bitcoin and feeling overwhelmed by price volatility, dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is the strategy that removes the stress from investing.

## What is DCA?

Dollar-cost averaging means investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of Bitcoin's price. Instead of trying to "buy the dip" or time the market perfectly, you simply buy the same dollar amount every week or month.

**Example**: You decide to invest $100 every Monday in Bitcoin.

- Week 1: Bitcoin is $45,000 → you buy 0.00222 BTC
- Week 2: Bitcoin is $42,000 → you buy 0.00238 BTC  
- Week 3: Bitcoin is $48,000 → you buy 0.00208 BTC
- Week 4: Bitcoin is $44,000 → you buy 0.00227 BTC

After one month, you've invested $400 and accumulated Bitcoin at an average price, without stressing about whether you bought at the "right" time.

## Why DCA Works for Beginners

**Removes emotional decisions**: You don't have to guess when prices are "low" or "high."

**Reduces timing risk**: By spreading purchases over time, you avoid putting all your money in at a potential peak.

**Builds consistency**: Small, regular investments add up significantly over months and years.

**Lower stress**: No need to watch price charts constantly or worry about market timing.

## How to Start DCA with Bitcoin

The easiest way to implement DCA is through platforms that support automatic recurring purchases:

1. **Choose a platform** like [River](https://river.com) that offers auto-buy features
2. **Set your amount**: Decide how much you can invest weekly or monthly
3. **Enable auto-buy**: Schedule automatic purchases
4. **Stay consistent**: Let it run without trying to "optimize" timing

## DCA vs. Lump Sum Investing

If you have $5,000 to invest, should you put it all in at once (lump sum) or spread it out (DCA)?

**Lump sum might win if** Bitcoin goes straight up from here. But you're taking maximum timing risk.

**DCA wins if** you value peace of mind, want to reduce timing risk, and prefer building wealth steadily.

For most beginners, DCA is the better choice because it removes the psychological burden of trying to time the perfect entry.

## Start Small, Stay Consistent

You don't need thousands of dollars to start. Even $25/week adds up:

- $25/week = $1,300/year
- Over 5 years = $6,500 invested
- With Bitcoin's historical growth, this builds significant wealth

The key is consistency, not the amount.

## Ready to Start?

Dollar-cost averaging is the boring, proven way to build Bitcoin wealth without gambling on market timing. Start with an amount you're comfortable with, set up automatic purchases, and let time do the work.
