Ready to start buying Bitcoin consistently? This guide walks you through everything you need to set up a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy in 2026.

## Step 1: Decide Your Investment Amount

**Ask yourself**: How much can I invest regularly without affecting my daily life?

**Good starting points**:
- $25/week ($100/month)
- $50/week ($200/month)  
- $100/week ($400/month)

Start conservative. You can always increase later. The most important factor is **consistency**, not the amount.

## Step 2: Choose Your DCA Frequency

**Weekly**: Smooths out volatility the most, 52 purchases per year
**Bi-weekly**: Aligns with paychecks, 26 purchases per year
**Monthly**: Simplest to manage, 12 purchases per year

Most beginners choose weekly or bi-weekly to maximize the DCA effect.

## Step 3: Select a Bitcoin Platform

Not all platforms support automatic recurring purchases. Here are the best options for DCA in 2026:

[**River**](https://river.com/invite?r=XRANN5QE) (Recommended for DCA)
- Clean interface for beginners
- Low fees on recurring purchases
- Strong security and insurance
- Automatic DCA built-in
- U.S. based and regulated

**Swan Bitcoin**
- DCA-first platform
- Very simple interface
- Automatic purchases
- Educational resources

**Coinbase** (If you prefer larger platform)
- Automatic recurring buys
- Higher fees than River/Swan
- More features (altcoins, staking)

**For pure Bitcoin DCA, River or Swan are optimal choices.**

## Step 4: Create Your Account

Using River as an example:

1. Go to [River.com](https://river.com/invite?r=XRANN5QE)
2. Sign up with email
3. Verify identity (required for U.S. customers)
4. Connect bank account
5. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for security

The verification process usually takes 1-2 business days.

## Step 5: Set Up Automatic Purchases

Once your account is verified:

1. Navigate to "Recurring Buy" or "Auto-Buy" settings
2. Enter your purchase amount (e.g., $50)
3. Choose frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly)
4. Select your purchase day (e.g., every Monday)
5. Confirm and activate

Your first purchase will happen on the next scheduled date.

## Step 6: Decide on Storage Strategy

**Keep on exchange** (for amounts under $1,000):
- Convenient for regular purchases
- Lower risk for small amounts
- Platforms like River have insurance

**Move to hardware wallet** (for larger amounts):
- Once you accumulate $1,000+ in Bitcoin
- Maximum security (you control private keys)
- Popular options: Ledger, Trezor

Most beginners start by keeping Bitcoin on the platform and move to hardware wallet once their holdings grow.

## Step 7: Set It and (Mostly) Forget It

The beauty of DCA is automation. Once it's set up:

- ✅ Purchases happen automatically
- ✅ You don't need to watch price charts
- ✅ You're not tempted to time the market
- ✅ You build wealth consistently

**Check in monthly** to:
- Verify purchases are executing
- Review your total holdings
- Adjust amount if your financial situation changes

## Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid

**Stopping during dips**: The best DCA buys happen when prices are down. Keep going.

**Trying to optimize timing**: "Maybe I'll skip this week and buy extra next week" defeats the purpose. Stay consistent.

**Over-investing**: Only invest money you won't need for 3-5 years minimum. Bitcoin is volatile short-term.

**Ignoring security**: Always enable 2FA and use strong, unique passwords.

## Your First Month Checklist

- [ ] Decide investment amount and frequency
- [ ] Choose platform ([River](https://river.com/invite?r=XRANN5QE) recommended)
- [ ] Create account and verify identity
- [ ] Connect bank account
- [ ] Enable 2FA security
- [ ] Set up automatic recurring purchases
- [ ] Make first purchase
- [ ] Set calendar reminder to review in 30 days

## What to Expect

**Month 1**: You'll watch the price closely. This is normal, but try to ignore it.

**Month 3**: You'll start seeing your Bitcoin stack grow and feel less anxious about daily price moves.

**Month 6**: DCA becomes a habit, like any other bill. You rarely think about the price.

**Year 1**: You'll look back and realize consistent investing beat trying to time the market.

## Ready to Begin?

Bitcoin DCA isn't glamorous, but it's proven. Set it up once, stay consistent, and let time compound your investment.

The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is today.
